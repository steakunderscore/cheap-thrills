## Cheap Thrills

This is an app that I have been writing as part of the interview process for a
position I'm currently applying for. The instructions are given below.

### Instructions given to me

The Montreal concert-going scene needs your help in discovering new artists and
bands to keep art alive. We have a special mission for you.

We need you to:

1. Start with concert listings at http://www.cheapthrills.ca/news.html and
   cross-reference it with a free music source on the Web. We want to create an
   online resource where music lovers can visit to know what band is coming to
   Montreal soon and when and where and be able to preview/listen to at least a
   song to have an idea.
2. Deploy this online resource on your own.
3. Use Ruby on Rails as your hammer. If you need data persistence, you can
   choose whatever you want.

Things to consider:

* What if we need to use a difference concert listing source?
* Could we support other cities?

* Can we enrich an existing list with a new source?
* Could we map the the concerts onto a map?
